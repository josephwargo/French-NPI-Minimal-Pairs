# NLPFinalProject
This is a small project I did for an NLP class. The PDF provides a much more thorough explanation than I could type up here.
I am in the process updating the scope to include evaluation of BERT-based transformers using the techniques outlined here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04094.pdf
